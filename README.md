# Rust-PlanterQuality
Rust Plugin - Applies quality multiplier for plants in planterboxes

The planterbox has to be in range of a tool cupboard.
If a player gains permission, the quality multiplier is applied with the next plant state change.
If a player looses permission, the quality multiplier is removed with the next plant state change.
